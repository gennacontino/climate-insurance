        <h2>Insurance premiums in California more than doubled in just three years after wildfires tore through the state – and some companies abandoned the state’s riskiest areas completely. How will a U.S. housing market without insurance work?</h2>

        <p>When a trailer’s tire burst on a Shasta County highway in 2018, the exposed steel rim scraped the asphalt, generating sparks in vegetation on the side of the road. The sparks quickly grew to flames on the dry California summer day. With the help of wind and 106 degree temperatures, the flames traveled to a nearby forest, licking the bark of Douglas firs and oak trees before engulfing them completely. </p>
        <p>The blaze roared for more than a month. What began with a blown tire grew to a 230,000-acre wildfire, killing eight and destroying $1.5 billion worth of insured property.
</p>
        <p>If the wildfire didn’t displace residents completely, it priced many of them out. From 2018 to 2021, the average insurance premium for a single-family home jumped from $500 to $1,260, according to California’s Department of Insurance.

        <p>This is just one of the ways climate change is altering the housing and insurance markets as we know them, making owning a home more expensive and unattainable than it already is. On top of high interest rates and low inventory, potential home buyers face the threat of busted pipes from unordinary extreme freezes in the South and the ocean swallowing valuable land along coastlines. The climate threats are causing some insurers to withdraw from risky areas completely, creating a pending home insurance meltdown. </p>
